# Next-Word-Prediction
 This project aims to develop a deep learning model for predicting the next word in a given sequence of words. The model is built using LSTM and GRU networks, which are well-suited for sequence prediction tasks

## Features
- Deep Learning Model: Uses an Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) built with TensorFlow/Keras.
- Interactive UI: Powered by Streamlit for real-time predictions.
