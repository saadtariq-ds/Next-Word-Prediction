# Next-Word-Prediction
 This project aims to develop a deep learning model for predicting the next word in a given sequence of words. The model is built using LSTM networks, which are well-suited for sequence prediction tasks

## Features
- Deep Learning Model: Uses an Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) built with TensorFlow/Keras.
- Interactive UI: Powered by Streamlit for real-time predictions.

1. Clone the Repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saadtariq-ds/Next-Word-Prediction.git
   ```
3. Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
5. Install Dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running Streamlit App
After installing the dependencies, launch the Streamlit app:
```
streamlit run app.py
